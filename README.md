# 👋 Hi, I’m Sigurd Vaaler

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a proud graduate from Noroff, where I dedicated countless hours to mastering code, keeping up with sports, and enjoying video games!. My passions include **ice hockey**, **Formula 1**, and continually advancing my skills as a **front-end developer**.

Front-end development wasn’t my original path—I started out as a truck mechanic with a trade certificate and spent nearly 5 years as a **heavyduty mechanic**. After a life-changing car accident made me rethink my career, I discovered my passion for front-end development. Now, I'm eager to see where this journey takes me next!!
