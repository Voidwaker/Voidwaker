# 👋 Hi, I’m Sigurd Vaaler

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm currently a student at Noroff, where I dedicate most of my time to coding, watching sports, and playing video games. My interests lie in **ice hockey**, **Formula 1**, and improving my skills as a **front-end developer**.

Front-end development wasn’t what I originally planned on studying. I have a trade certificate as a truck mechanic and worked as a **heavyduty mechanic** for almost 5 years. After being in a car accident, I had to reconsider my career, and that's how I found my passion for front-end development. Now, I'm excited about where this journey is taking me!
