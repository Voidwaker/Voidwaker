#introduction!!
im sigurd, currently a student at noroff, i dedicate most of my time to ether write some code, watch sports or play videogames, mostly ufc, icehockey and formula1. when it comes to gaming, i usualy play league of legends(currently p3 draven otp) 
im really looking forward to become a better front-end developer! 

front-end dev wasnt something i planed on studying at first, i have a trade certificate as a truck mechanic, worked as an heavyduty mechaning for almost 5 years, before i was in a car accident.
after that i had to restructure, because i couldnt do my current job, so here we are! front-end dev here we come!
