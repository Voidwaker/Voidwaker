My name is  sigurd, currently a student at noroff, i dedicate most of my time to ether write some code, watch sports or play videogames, icehockey and formula1. when it comes to gaming,
im really looking forward to become a better front-end developer! 

front-end dev wasnt something i planed on studying at first. I have a trade certificate as a truck mechanic, worked as an heavyduty mechanic for almost 5 years, before i was in a car accident.
after that i had to restructure, because i couldnt do my current job, so here we are! front-end dev here we come!
